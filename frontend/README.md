# Frontend of My Workspace Project

This is the frontend part of the My Workspace project, built using React. The application includes a chatbot that interacts with users and provides responses based on trained fields.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the React application in development mode, run:
```
npm start
```

This will start the application and open it in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

To create a production build of the application, run:
```
npm run build
```

This will generate a `build` folder containing the optimized production files.

### Chatbot Component

The chatbot is implemented in the `Chatbot.js` component located in the `src/components` directory. It handles user interactions and communicates with the backend to fetch responses.

### Folder Structure

- `public/`: Contains the static files, including `index.html`.
- `src/`: Contains the React components and styles.
  - `components/`: Contains individual React components.
  - `App.js`: The main application component.
  - `index.js`: The entry point for the React application.

### Scripts

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm test`: Runs the test suite.
